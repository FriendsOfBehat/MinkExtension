PHP 8.0 on Travis is working now.
Can someone merge this, and make a release so that people who have this as a dependency can also move forward to PHP 8.0?

@dunglas do you have any reason not to merge this PR ?

@nicodmf I'm not a maintainer of this project, I don't have the merge permission.

@pamil I see that you merged a PR last year. Can you please review this one?
I guess that you have maintainer privs here?

Or @lchrusciel @Zales0123 ?
